# Belly Button Biodiversity

Complete a dashboard website to display demographic information of belly button bacterial species. If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, donaters will be able to check the website to identify whether that bacterial species is found in quantity in their belly button.

## Resources
